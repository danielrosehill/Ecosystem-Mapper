# Example Ecosystem Maps

**Source**: Ecosystem maps taken from public sources

This folder contains reference ecosystem and market landscape maps collected from various public sources. These examples serve as visual style guides for the ecosystem maps that will be generated by the Ecosystem Mapper agent.

## Map Types Represented

### Market Maps & Landscape Visualizations
- **market-landscape-multi-category.png**: Multi-category technology market landscape
- **industrial-internet-landscape.png**: Industrial internet ecosystem overview
- **ai-2025-market-map-use-cases.png**: AI market segmented by use cases and applications
- **generative-ai-market-map-segmented.png**: Generative AI market with consumer, enterprise, and developer segments

### Stack & Layer Visualizations
- **generative-ai-infrastructure-stack.png**: Infrastructure stack showing layers from foundation models to production
- **ai-stack-vertical-integration-comparison.png**: Comparative view of AI stack vertical integration

### Specialized Ecosystem Maps
- **agentic-ai-universe-circular.png**: Circular/concentric design showing agentic AI landscape
- **taiwan-ai-ecosystem-2021-h1.png**: Regional ecosystem map (Taiwan AI, H1 2021)

## Purpose

These maps demonstrate different visualization approaches:
- **Grid/Category-based layouts**: Organizing companies/projects into clear categories
- **Layered stack views**: Showing hierarchical relationships in technology stacks
- **Circular/radial designs**: Emphasizing central concepts with expanding scope
- **Segmented views**: Dividing markets by customer type or use case

The Ecosystem Mapper agent will analyze these patterns and apply similar visualization strategies when generating new ecosystem maps.

## Usage

These images are used as:
1. Visual style references for the map generation module
2. Examples of effective categorization and layout strategies
3. Inspiration for color schemes and organizational patterns

## Note

All images are from publicly available sources and used here for reference purposes only. They demonstrate the target output quality and style for this project's automated ecosystem mapping capabilities.
